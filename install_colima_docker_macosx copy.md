# Run Oracle Database 23ai Free on Mac computers with Apple silicon


But what about Oracle 23ai and the newer M1/M2/M3 ARM based Apple silicon Macs I hear you ask, so here you go.


See the next blog to understand the complexity [Here](https://ronekins.com/2024/07/02/run-oracle-database-23ai-free-on-mac-computers-with-apple-silicon/)


## Preinstallation

You need to install Rosetta2 if it is not already installed (Open Terminal in your MAC OSX Mx):

```Code

softwareupdate --install-rosetta



I have read and agree to the terms of the software license agreement. A list of Apple SLAs may be found here: https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/
Type A and press return to agree: A
2024-08-14 17:58:43.771 softwareupdate[67564:9084300] Package Authoring Error: 062-01890: Package reference com.apple.pkg.RosettaUpdateAuto is missing installKBytes attribute
Install of Rosetta 2 finished successfully


```

Start by installing the Homebrew package manager, if not already installed.

Now, install Colima container runtime and Docker if not already installed on your Mac.

```Code

brew --version

brew install colima docker
brew install docker-compose
brew reinstall qemu
```

You could see next results:

```Code

zsh completions have been installed to:
  /opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions

To start colima now and restart at login:
  brew services start colima
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/colima/bin/colima start -f

```

Restart colima

```Code

brew services restart colima

```


Check the installation:

```Code

colima --version
colima version 0.7.3

docker --version
Docker version 27.1.2, build d01f264bcc
```


If we now try docker ps to check for processes, we see a docker daemon error message:

```Code
docker ps
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```


## Start Colima Container Runtime

If you want to deploy containers created in x86_64 architecture, we must start Colima Container Runtime like this: 

```Code
# colima start  --arch x86_64 --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta --mount-type=virtiofs  --memory 8 --cpu 4

colima start  --arch x86_64 --memory 8 --cpu 4

WARN[0000] 'architecture' cannot be updated after initial setup, discarded 
WARN[0000] 'virtual machine type' cannot be updated after initial setup, discarded 
WARN[0000] 'volume mount type' cannot be updated after initial setup, discarded 
INFO[0000] starting colima                              
INFO[0000] runtime: docker                              
INFO[0002] starting ...                                  context=vm
INFO[0013] provisioning ...                              context=docker
INFO[0014] starting ...                                  context=docker
INFO[0016] done                                         

```

We can confirm the Colima Container Runtime configuration with colima status and colima list, for example.

```Code

colima status

INFO[0001] colima is running using macOS Virtualization.Framework 
INFO[0001] arch: x86_64                                 
INFO[0001] runtime: docker                              
INFO[0001] mountType: virtiofs                          
INFO[0001] socket: unix:///Users/operard/.colima/default/docker.sock 



colima list

PROFILE    STATUS     ARCH       CPUS    MEMORY    DISK     RUNTIME    ADDRESS
default    Running    aarch64    2       8GiB      60GiB    docker     

```

Before we try and start any container, letâ€™s check for Docker processes using docker ps.

We now no longer see the Docker daemon error message.

```Code

docker

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
We can check for existing docker images with docker images, for example.

docker images

REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
The docker context show command should return colima, which means Docker runs under Colima and you can therefore use docker commands as usual.

docker context show

colima
```


## Clean the colima and docker deployment in MAC OSX

If you must clean your environment in order to reset it, use the next commands:

```Code

colima stop


INFO[0000] stopping colima                              
INFO[0000] stopping ...                                  context=docker
INFO[0004] stopping ...                                  context=vm
INFO[0007] done                                         

colima delete


are you sure you want to delete colima and all settings? [y/N] y
INFO[0001] deleting colima                              
INFO[0002] done                                         

```
